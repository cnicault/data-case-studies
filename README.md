## Credit Card Fraud Detection
----
This study is based on the dataset *Credit Card Fraud Detection* **Anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine** provided by kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) .
I first did an exploratory data analysis, and used a logistic regression algorithm to build a model to detect fraud transaction. The dataset is highly imbalanced, I used precision and recall to measure the accuracy of the model, and tried different sampling method to improve the performance.
